# Project details
## Title of devroom

Embedded, Mobile and Automotive

## Elaborate description of proposed devroom (including possible topics)

Embedded Mobile and Automotive gathers hardware hackers, Linux fans
and low-level programming enthusiasts. Its main goal is to showcase
open source projects and allow people to share their experience,
exchange knowledge and foster open collaboration.

Possible topics include:
* Hardware hacking
* FOSS in embedded programming
* The Linux Kernel
* FOSS in mobile area
* FOSS in automotive area

## Why does it fit FOSDEM?

The Embedded, Mobile and Automotive industries heavily depend on
FOSS. There are so many related open source projects that it is almost
impossible to know them all. That's why we believe that knowledge
sharing is a main goal of this devroom.

The devroom used to be a great way of connecting open source
contributors from all related projects. Resurrecting the devroom will
attract low level programmers to visit the conference and allow us to
stimulate embedded community integration.

## Preferred slot

Both days (2x half a day)
